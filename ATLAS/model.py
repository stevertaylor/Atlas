"""The NumPyro model at the top of an ATLAS run.

``model_maker`` is the actual entry point of a fit: it samples the timing model
(optionally), the white noise (optionally), the red-noise spectrum and the
non-centred coefficients, then hands the log-density to NumPyro. It lived in
``samplers/canetoadracing.py`` next to the vendored ``MultiHMCGibbs`` kernels,
where it both hid the top of the model inside a sampler module and collided by
name with ``SuperSignal.model_maker`` -- an unrelated method that builds the phi
parameterisation. Grep for one and you found the other.

``from ATLAS.samplers.canetoadracing import model_maker`` still works.

The ``numpyro.factor('lnpost', lprob + 0.5 * sum(z_a**2))`` line at the end is
load-bearing and not obviously so. Both likelihoods return a density in the
*reparameterised* coordinate, and NumPyro has already added the ``N(0, 1)``
log-prior for ``z_a`` from the ``sample`` statement above; the ``+0.5 sum(z^2)``
cancels that double-count. Removing it silently corrupts the posterior rather
than raising, which is why ``tests/test_identities.py`` pins the identity
directly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    red_noise_basis : array, optional
        The T-matrix. Only consulted when the helpers are rebuilt inside the model
        (``vary_white=True``, or a sampled timing model). Defaults to the signal's
        own ``get_Fmat_concat``.

        Pass it explicitly -- as a model argument through ``MCMC.run``, with
        ``MCMC(..., jit_model_args=True)`` -- when the helpers are rebuilt every
        leapfrog step. Left to default it is captured from the signal object and
        XLA writes it into the potential-energy executable as a literal; on the
        NANOGrav 15-year set that is several GB of generated code. As a model
        argument it is traced, and the executable holds a pointer instead.

    tm_direct_sampling_type : str, optional
        How a sampled timing model is parameterised. ``'klam'`` (the default)
        draws a global scale ``timing_lam`` and unit-scale coefficients
        ``timing_k`` and forms the residuals from their product. Anything else
        calls ``tm_model.sample_residuals()``, which samples each pulsar's
        physical timing parameters directly from their bounded priors.

    Notes
    -----
    This drives the stochastic model only. A ``'det'`` block needs three more
    sets of sites -- the deterministic parameters, and for a continuous wave a
    phase and a distance per pulsar -- and the distance prior in particular is a
    per-array input this function has no access to (``PTA_Data`` carries
    ``psr_pos`` but no distances). It is rejected here rather than half-sampled:
    write the NumPyro model yourself and pass ``D_params`` to
    ``lnposterior_reparam`` / ``partial_marg_lnposterior``. The README's
    "Deterministic signals" section has the template.
